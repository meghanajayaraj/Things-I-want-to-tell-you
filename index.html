            <p><strong>*</strong>So initially I don't want to mention it.But today I want to talk to you about this.You should reconsider about 
                drinking and smoking, I am not saying to quit it over night, But consider your health.Because I already told you, I want
                a happy family with you 👪, I am so concerned about your health.You may say you are drinking limited, But we both know that you are
                at a stage you can't quit.we both are aware that you are already addicted.What i want to tell you is, you can't quit overnight..
                but consider quitting...slowly decrease it...And let me know if you want my support and help quitting it.I know nana, one day 
                you can quit it completely...And I hope so 🤞
            </p>

            <p><strong>*</strong> I have a habit of loooking at your pictures when I miss you ❤️‍🩹.When I am sad because of something 
                just looking at your pictures brings back my enargy ✨.I honestly miss you so much.And this long distance relationship,
                it's not that easy.you are a boy 👦and you always have so many things to do, and you'll hangout with frnds 👨‍👨‍👦.May be with
                all those works, you may miss me less.But as a girl 👧, always staying at home 🏠, being free, I miss you a lot.
                You never leave my mind.So if I start calculating rent, you have to pay me a lot...so you have to
                pay me back with the patent rights of your life 💯.
